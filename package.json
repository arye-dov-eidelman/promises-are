  "description": "A tool for creating promises that'll fulfill or reject based on the state of an array of promises. Similar to Promise.all and Promise.any, While allowing more finer control over when/if a it'll fullfil or reject via a callback function. The callback will be called every time any of the promises state changes. Some usage examples: `Promises are mostly done with a 90 percent success rate`, `promises are very slow`, `promises have a high error rate`, `promises when progress updates`.",
